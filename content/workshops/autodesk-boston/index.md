# Welcome and Pre-read

Dear Autodesk Friends,

Iâ€™m very excited about our upcoming workshop next Monday and Tuesday (March 17-18), and looking forward to meeting you all!

The schedule for our workshop is above. There might be some small adjustments as we see how things go, but the general contours won't change.

Our sessions will start promptly at 9:00am in the morning, with an hour for lunch at 12:15pm, and ending for the day at 5:00pm. There are two short breaks during the day. We'll have some informal chat over lunch, which will be served in the room, so don't plan to go somewhere else!

In advance of the workshop, I'd like you to read some short pieces for some background. The first is an overview of concept design:

[Three Stages of Enlightenment](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/three-stages/) (13 minute read)
	
The second is a very brief explanation of how concept design fits in with other kinds of design: 

[Levels of Design](https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/levels-of-design/) (3 minute read)

And the third is a short piece I wrote about the spirit of design, and how great designs don't spring out of the air but emerge from hard work polishing and refining ideas:

[How Great Design Happens](https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/great-design/) (4 minute read)
	
I hope you enjoy these and find them helpful. There are several other pieces on the [concept design website](https://essenceofsoftware.com) that you might find interesting, for example one about [how LLMs will upend the principles of agile development](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/end-of-agile/), and one about how concept design is being [used at Palantir](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/palantir/). 

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I can be reached by email at [dnj@conceptualstrategy.com](mailto:dnj@conceptualstrategy.com).

Best wishes,

Daniel
