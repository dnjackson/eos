# Goals
- To give participants basic proficiency in concept design
- To train leaders for infusing concept design into Autodesk
- To help align participants in their design work, across roles & teams
- To get some experience applying concept design in a work project
- To encourage participants to reflect on their strategies when designing

# General structure
- The workshop will be on August 25 and 26
- Each day will run from 9:00am to 5:00pm
- Each day will break for lunch from 12:00-1:00
- Shorter breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon
- Sessions will include presentations, discussions & exercises

# Agenda
- Monday am: Conceptual models & the idea of concepts
- Monday pm: Defining user-facing behavior in a UI-independent way
- Tuesday am: Composing concepts & modularity
- Tuesday pm: Project work (eg, on Unified Design concepts)

# Pre-reading
In advance of the workshop, I’d like you to read some short pieces for some background:
- An overview of concept design: [Three Stages of Enlightenment](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/three-stages/) (13 minute read)
- A brief explanation of how concept design fits in with other kinds of design: [Levels of Design](https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/levels-of-design/) (3 minute read)
- A short piece about the spirit of design, and how great design happens: [How Great Design Happens](https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/great-design/) (4 minute read)
I hope you enjoy these and find them helpful. There are several other pieces on the [concept design website](https://essenceofsoftware.com/) that you might find interesting, for example one about [how LLMs will upend the principles of agile development](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/end-of-agile/).

# Homework
In advance of the workshop, I'd like you to think a little about your own design work, and answer the following questions by submitting [this form](https://forms.gle/TBcTHzg4wMRdvpxY7) by August 10:
- What are some key strategies you use in design?
- What is a recent user-facing design problem that you've worked on? What was the problem and how did you solve it (or not)?
- What questions or concerns about concept design are you hoping the workshop will answer?
