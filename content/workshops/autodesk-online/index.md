# Pre-read

In advance of the workshop, I'd like you to read some short pieces for some background. The first is an overview of concept design:

[Three Stages of Enlightenment](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/three-stages/) (13 minute read)
	
The second is a very brief explanation of how concept design fits in with other kinds of design: 

[Levels of Design](https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/levels-of-design/) (3 minute read)

And the third is a short piece I wrote about the spirit of design, and how great designs don't spring out of the air but emerge from hard work polishing and refining ideas:

[How Great Design Happens](https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/great-design/) (4 minute read)
	
I hope you enjoy these and find them helpful. There are several other pieces on the [concept design website](https://essenceofsoftware.com) that you might find interesting, for example one about [how LLMs will upend the principles of agile development](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/end-of-agile/), and one about how concept design is being [used at Palantir](https://essenceofsoftware.com/posts/palantir/).
