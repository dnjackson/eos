## Will you answer rude questions?
Sure, take a look [here](/rude/). And if your question isn’t answered, just email me or post it in the [forum](http://forum.essenceofsoftware.com).

## Where can I learn more?

From the book, of course :-). But also [sample chapters](/posts/sample-chapters), my [ACM tech talk](/posts/acm-tech-talk), an [article](/posts/three-stages) on the 3 stages of concept enlightenment, a series of [gentle intros](/tutorials/) and a comprehensive [summary](/posts/distillation). To join in discussions about concept design, visit the [forum](http://forum.essenceofsoftware.com)!

## Why did you write this book?

Some software is a delight to use---powerful, flexible, easy---and some is clunky and complicated. I wanted to figure out why, so I spent ten years studying good and bad features of well known apps in the hope that I could find some general principles. This book is the result. 

## Is this a practical book?

Yes! In a series of short chapters, using examples drawn from over 100 familiar apps, I explain the key ideas and principles and show you how to apply them. Then for readers who need more, there's an extensive collection of free-standing 'explorations' that delve more deeply into design subtleties and explain how concept design relates to everything from data abstraction to design thinking.

## Who is it for?

The book is written for everyone who creates software—programmers, software architects, product managers and UX designers; for all those who guide its development—VCs, CTOs, startup founders, marketers, analysts and consultants; for novices and experts, students and researchers; and for all of us who would like to have a deeper understanding of the software we use every day.

## Do you teach workshops?

Yes. I offer a variety of teaching sessions and workshops of varying size and focus; contact [me](/author) for details.
