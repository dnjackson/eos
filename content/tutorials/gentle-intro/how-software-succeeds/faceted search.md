Ben Shneiderman. 2002. Promoting universal usability with multi-layer interface design. In Proceedings of the 2003 conference on Universal usability (CUU '03). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 1–8. https://doi.org/10.1145/957205.957206

Boring paper: basically just packaging of feature subsets.

This paper promotes the idea of multi-layer interface designs that enable first-time and novice users to begin with a limited set of features at layer 1. They can remain at layer 1, then move up to higher layers when needed or when they have time to learn further features.

While techno-utopians believe that computing technology has steadily improved over four decades, the fact remains that it is too unreliable, too difficult to use, and too error prone. 

A second disturbing aspect, revealed by Internet usage data, is the inequity of access, often called the digital divide. In the United States, among low income and poorly educated users Internet usage is around 15% while among high income and well-educated users Internet usage is over 80% [12]. 

Designers can do more to accommodate the struggling first time user, the troubled novice, and the disenfranchised Internet dropout.

Coutaz: Plasticity is the capacity of a user interface to withstand variations of both the system physical characteristics and the environment while preserving usability. Typically, a `plastic' electronic agenda would run both on a workstation and on a hand-held computer without requiring a complete system redesign and re-implementation.

Carroll: minimalism. An approach to documentation based on 9 principles: include modularity, exploiting prior knowledge, training on real tasks, getting going fast, coordinate system and training, support error recognition and recovery, using the situation (look into this), optimal training designs, reasoning and improvising. Maybe worth reading the book?

A notable success story in serving novice as well as expert web users is the use of basic and advanced features in search engines.

The idea of multiple layers was a success in the 1987 HyperCard package from Apple, which enabled novice users to merely read hyper-linked documents. As users became familiar with the interface, they could move to higher layers, enabling them to add buttons and links, then to author new documents, create graphics, and finally to write programs. A contemporary variant in a complex product is the layered design of Adobe Framemaker.

Fix design moves paper figure

Basic idea
- provide more general functionality
- allow reuse of existing concept, so recognition more than invention often
- can progressive disclosure or levels
- often involves making polymorphic
- not more low level, rather less domain specific and more generic
- key that it’s still understandable to the user

# Examples

Book store. Filter on hardback/paperback/ebook: platform. Better example would be something that isn’t a store, so faceted search less obvious. Photo catalog: sort by camera, whether JPG RAW etc.
Invented by Shneiderman and co.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search
Nice explanation of faceted search

From label match to label formula.

Notification: from send email if reply to post to register for events, whether to digest, etc.

Introducing style or paste properties?
Hardwired styles like Google doc has fixed set of styles but can update them. Mailchimp has no real styles, super painful. Powerpoint has no styles?

From multiple mailing addresses to address book.


Fromsingle action compensation to Undo.

From admin flag to RBAC
From prerequisites to Karma
From coupon to loyalty program.

Reservation conflict.
Ask GPT to help with this?

how is this different from general feature expansion or generalization? what characteristics of the original use case make it brittle or ad hoc?



# Design moves
This is a basic strategy with CD
could call it a design move
but so basic i reserved the term for concept to concept moves

design moves go beyond this
unify/specialize
unify: moira list
specialize: Lr ratings, flags etc

faceted search
label / todo property
notification on reply to post


arises from crossing concept boundary
