      <description>Motivation: Defining Behavior The operational principle of a concept explains its archetypal behavior: how it’s typically used, and how it fulfills its purpose. But for a concept to be flexible and powerful, it should work in many different scenarios, so we need a way to pin down the behavior in detail.
Using the notion of a state machine, we can define how a concept will behave in every possible situation. Then we can analyze the design to make sure that the behavior is always acceptable.</description>

      <description>Any software app, service or system can be viewed as a collection of interacting concepts.
Concepts are the building blocks of software Imagine explaining Twitter to someone who&amp;rsquo;s never used it. You might tell them about the Tweet and Follower concepts, then maybe Hashtag and Like (aka Upvote), and if they&amp;rsquo;re keen to know even more, you could explain VerifiedAccount or Bookmark.
Each concept can be explained with a purpose (what it&amp;rsquo;s for) and an operational principle (how you use it):</description>

      <guid>https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/concept-basics/apps-are-state-machines/</guid>
      <description>If user experience runs deeper than the user interface, we need a way to talk about an app that isn’t just visual, and that captures behavior in a more fundamental way.
Programmers think in terms of complicated things like objects, callbacks, streams, functionals, and so on. They’re essential for structuring code, but for behavior a much simpler model is effective.
State machines That model is the state machine. You’ve probably come across state machines, either in a class about the theory of computation, or seeing diagrams like this:</description>

      <description>In the 1980s, there was a revolution in software. The Apple Macintosh came out (building on the invention of the WIMP interface at PARC), Don Norman wrote The Design of Everyday Things, and the first CHI conference was held.
Now everyone knows how important user interface design is, and there’s no excuse for messing it up. You can find several collections of UI design heuristics (such as Nielsen’s) online, and many companies publish standards for how to use UI widgets consistently (here’s Google’s, for example).</description>

      <guid>https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/misfits/</guid>
      <description>What is a design problem? What exactly is a design problem? And why are design problems often hard to solve?
The most compelling answer to this question, in my view, comes from Christopher Alexander in his influential book Notes on the Synthesis of Form (1964).
Most of the book is about a way to structure goals into a tree, by noting alignments and conflicts between them, and grouping them to minimize conflicts across groups.</description>

      <title>Generic fitness criteria</title>

      <guid>https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/fitness-criteria/</guid>
      <description>Seven criteria What makes a design fit for purpose depends—surprise!—on the purpose. But generic criteria are helpful for two reasons. First, they give you some basis for evaluation, however crude. Second, they can be used as a checklist to suggest more specific ones.
A software product should be:
Efficient: letting users accomplish their goals with no more steps or effort than needed; Flexible: supporting not just one fixed and narrow goal, but a range of goals that users are likely to have; Responsive: responding to requests from the user in a timely way; Understandable: behaving predictably, offering options and producing outcomes that make sense to users; Robust: tolerant of errors made by the user and other common perturbations of context, such as failures of other systems or agents to perform their expected roles; Secure: resistant to malicious attacks, including social engineering attacks that induce the user to perform unintended actions.</description>

      <title>How great design happens</title>

      <guid>https://essenceofsoftware.com/tutorials/design-general/great-design/</guid>
      <description>Think about your favorite product, whether it’s a photo-editing app or a toaster, and ask yourself: how did it get to be so good?
With all the hype in the design world about creativity and brainstorming, it’s easy to imagine that great designs simply appear, out of the blue. Someone conjures up a new idea, and it just needs to be translated from sketch to product. Maybe many details need to be added, but the quality of the design was there at the start—like a tiny seed that grows spontaneously into a magnificent tree.</description>

      <description>When you’re diagnosing a usability snag, or coming up with a new design idea, it’s helpful to know what level you’re working at.
Over the years, designers and researchers have defined various levels, reflecting their view of design and what they emphasize.
I find the following scheme most helpful:
Physical. If you want to think of levels as low and high, this one is at the bottom. It’s the level of design in which you’re concerned about the physical (and physiological) qualities of human users.</description>

      <description>A compelling way to explain how something works is to tell a story. Not any story, but a kind of defining story that shows, through a typical scenario, why the thing is useful and fulfills its purpose.
The Minuteman Library Network, for example, offers a wonderful service. If I request a book, then when it becomes available at my local library, I get an email notifying me that it’s ready to be picked up.</description>

      <description>Most of us* believe that simplicity is the key to design. I’m a sucker for the best quotes about it. Here are some of my favorites. First, Tony Hoare in his Turing Award lecture lamenting the complexity of Algol-68:
I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.</description>

      <description>A while back, I discovered a fascinating book called The Essence of Software by Prof. Daniel Jackson. It describes a semi-formal design method called “concept design”.
The concept design method is adjacent to many of the themes that inspire me—Christopher Alexander’s design patterns, the design science movement, category theory, methods as tools for thought…
I’ve been chatting back and forth with Daniel and am delighted to have him share a couple of guest posts.</description>

      <description>A Concept Model of Noosphere Warning Heavy-duty concept design ahead! This note exploring the concept design of Noosphere is not for the faint-hearted. For those who aren&amp;rsquo;t very familiar with the concepts of decentralized storage (which includes me!) or who are learning concept design for the first time, this is likely not the best introduction to concepts.
Why conceptualize Noosphere? This note applies my theory of concept design to Gordon Brander&amp;rsquo;s Noosphere.</description>

      <description>Motivation: Defining Behavior Using the notion of a state machine, we can define how a concept will behave in every possible situation.
The Role of State The state of a concept plays a very straightforward role, and that’s to determine what the concept remembers at runtime. The state is the concept’s memory. If some piece of information is needed in an action, then it will have to be in the memory; if it will never be needed, it shouldn’t be there, even if it’s interesting.</description>
