<meta name="description" content="Concept design builds on many familiar ideas. To mention a few:

From use cases and user stories, concept design takes the idea that software interacts with the world through scenarios that deliver value.
From user-centered design (as taught by Don Norman in The Design of Everyday Things), concept design takes the idea that the user interface is a kind of apparition (a “system image” in Norman’s phrasing) that stands between the user and the system, revealing only indirectly the underlying reality. When the user’s understanding (their “mental model”) is not aligned with this reality (the “conceptual model”), the system becomes unusable.
From domain-driven design (and its predecessors, such as OMT and JSD), concept design takes the idea that the most stable part of a system’s function may be grounded in structures that already exist in the problem domain.

In each of these cases, concept design goes in new directions. Unlike use cases, the scenarios of concept design are not used as specifications. Whereas user-centered design focuses on building the system image that connects the conceptual model to the mental model, concept design focuses on the conceptual model itself.
