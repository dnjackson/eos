  "articleBody": "Goals and Principles These notes are intended to contribute to the design of a tutor based on GPT that Geoffrey is building for use in Software Studio this fall.\nSome of the goals of building and deploying the tutor are:\nTo get some initial experience using GPT-like tools in education; To help students learn concept design; To gather data both about students’ learning of concept design and about the performance of the AI tutor; To refine the pedagogy around concept design. Some design principles of the tutor are:\nTo make the simplest thing that works; While serving the needs of concept design, to make the tutor as general as possible so that it can be applied in other domains; To reduce barrier to usage by students; To make it easy for class staff to change the materials and exercises; To implement using the class tech stack–Node/Express, Vue (or React if that’s easier for Geoffrey)–so the tutor can be used as an exemplar for students and also easily modified by staff; Identifying concepts The central concept captures the protocol of interacting with tools like GPT:\nconcept ChatBot purpose interact with AI agent principle new (p, s); ask (s, t); respond (s, t); ... state prompt: Session -\u003e one Text questions, answers: Session -\u003e seq Text actions new (prompt: Text, out s: Session) // create new session with given prompt ask (s: Session, t: Text) // user enters text respond (s: Session, t: Text) // bot responds close (s: Session) // needed? The operational principle says that a new session is created with a prompt; in our design, this will turn out to be hidden from the user. The user then enters some text (modeled by the ask action) and the bot responds.\nThe prompt will turn out to be a concatenation of distinct components, such as a general tactic for the bot to follow; a pedagogical context for the exercise at hand; and the starting seed for the exercise itself (eg, “ask the user to do X”).\nThe student will work in a mutable buffer, generating a sequence of immutable texts:\nconcept Buffer purpose create immutable text with mutable buffer principle // if you create a buffer and edit it, // saving produces the last content new (b); edit (b, t); save (t') {t' = t} state content: Buffer -\u003e one Text actions new (out b: Buffer) // create new buffer edit (b: Buffer, t: Text) // edit buffer so new content is t save (b: Buffer, t: Text) // save contents of buffer close (b: Buffer) // needed? The save action is intended to be sync’d with another concept; I’ve factored out the means by which the text is saved.\nThe chatbot is fueled by a repository of advice, which I’ll model as a concept that offers advice on various topics:\nconcept Advice [Topic] purpose manage repo of advice principle // create topic, add advice, then getting // advice will return all advice added to that // topic newTopic (n, t); addAdvice (t, a1)... addAdvice (t, aN); get (t, a') {a' = a1 + ... + aN} state advices: Topic -\u003e set Text name: Topic lone -\u003e one Text actions newTopic (name: Text, out t: Topic) addAdvice (t: Topic, advice: Text) getAdvice (t: Topic, out advices: set Text) Side notes. This is a strange concept because it has so little behavior but it seems to represent a very significant part of the tutor, and would likely have its own code. I’ve included an action getAdvice to help reify the operational principle even though the state is visible and observer actions aren’t generally needed (but I think I should rethink this for OP-relevant state observations). At first, I incorporated advice into a concept that managed exercise/part structure, but then when I realized that that concept needed to incorporate the student behavior, it became too complex and I decided this was a better concept to factor out than a student behavior concept. Could this concept be made more similar to one that already exists, such as a Q\u0026A concept of the sort you might use to model StackOverflow etc? In the AI tutor setting, the advice will be given to the chatbot, not the student, but this should be irrelevant in the design of the concept.\nThe pedagogical content is organized as a collection of exercises with multiple parts; the parts are associated with competencies (which will be the topics for advice).\nconcept Exercise [Competency] purpose maintain and offer structured exercises principle // admin creates exercise with parts // when student selects part, they get // the relevant descriptions newExercise(te, e); newPart (e, tp, c, p); selectPart (e, p, t', c') {t' = te^tp, c' = c} state parts: Exercise one -\u003e set Part competence: Part -\u003e one Competency description: Exercise + Part -\u003e one Text actions newExercise (t: Text, out e: Exercise) newPart (e: Exercise, t: Text, c: Competency, out p: Part) selectPart (e: Exercise, p: Part, out t: Text, out c: Competency) // when student selects a part of an exercise, // they're given a description that combines // the description of the exercise with the // description of the part (and the competency // they'll acquire) Notes\nBoth exercises and their parts have descriptions Competency associated only with parts and not whole exercises. This will mean we can’t associate advice with exercises as a whole. Perhaps advice common to all parts is just included for those parts? Parts are not shared between exercises Considered including student behavior in this concept to make it richer but then decided it was more important to factor it out so that the student behavior concept could be lifted over students (that is, each student behavior being independent) Concept for student behavior:\nconcept Drill purpose govern student work blah... principle // if you select a task and one of its subtasks // and then submit a solution, it's recorded // appropriately selectTask (t); selectSubTask (t, t'); submit (s) {t' in t.subtasks and t.solution = s} state subtasks: Task one -\u003e set Task solution: Task -\u003e lone Text current: lone Task actions selectTask (t: Task) // set current to t selectSubTask (super, sub: Task) // set current to sub // ensure sub a subtask of super submit (t: Text) // current.solution := t Notes\nDecided to make this cursor-based; not sure this is a good idea, but seems useful to have this state somewhere in the app. OP is not very satisfying but at least suggests how concept is used.

<p>These notes are intended to contribute to the design of a tutor based on GPT that Geoffrey is building for use in Software Studio this fall.</p>
<p>Some of the goals of building and deploying the tutor are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get some initial experience using GPT-like tools in education;</li>
<li>To help students learn concept design;</li>
<li>To gather data both about students’ learning of concept design and about the performance of the AI tutor;</li>
<li>To refine the pedagogy around concept design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some design principles of the tutor are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To make the simplest thing that works;</li>
<li>While serving the needs of concept design, to make the tutor as general as possible so that it can be applied in other domains;</li>
<li>To reduce barrier to usage by students;</li>
<li>To make it easy for class staff to change the materials and exercises;</li>
<li>To implement using the class tech stack&ndash;Node/Express, Vue (or React if that’s easier for Geoffrey)&ndash;so the tutor can be used as an exemplar for students and also easily modified by staff;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identifying-concepts">Identifying concepts<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#identifying-concepts">#</a></h2>
<p>The central concept captures the protocol of interacting with tools like GPT:</p>
<pre><code>concept ChatBot
purpose interact with AI agent
principle
  new (p, s); ask (s, t); respond (s, t); ...
state
  prompt: Session -&gt; one Text
  questions, answers: Session -&gt; seq Text
actions
  new (prompt: Text, out s: Session)
  	// create new session with given prompt
  ask (s: Session, t: Text)
  	// user enters text
  respond (s: Session, t: Text)
  	// bot responds
  close (s: Session)
  	// needed?
</code></pre>
<p>The operational principle says that a new session is created with a prompt; in our design, this will turn out to be hidden from the user. The user then enters some text (modeled by the <em>ask</em> action) and the bot <em>responds</em>.</p>
<p>The prompt will turn out to be a concatenation of distinct components, such as a general tactic for the bot to follow; a pedagogical context for the exercise at hand; and the starting seed for the exercise itself (eg, “ask the user to do X”).</p>
<p>The student will work in a mutable buffer, generating a sequence of immutable texts:</p>
<pre><code>concept Buffer
purpose create immutable text with mutable buffer
principle
  // if you create a buffer and edit it,
  // saving produces the last content
  new (b); edit (b, t); save (t') {t' = t}
state
  content: Buffer -&gt; one Text
actions
  new (out b: Buffer)
  	// create new buffer
  edit (b: Buffer, t: Text)
  	// edit buffer so new content is t
  save (b: Buffer, t: Text)
  	// save contents of buffer
  close (b: Buffer)
  	// needed?
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>save</em> action is intended to be sync’d with another concept; I’ve factored out the means by which the text is saved.</p>
<p>The chatbot is fueled by a repository of advice, which I’ll model as a concept that offers advice on various topics:</p>
<pre><code>concept Advice [Topic]
purpose manage repo of advice
principle
  // create topic, add advice, then getting
  // advice will return all advice added to that
  // topic
  newTopic (n, t); addAdvice (t, a1)... addAdvice (t, aN); get (t, a') {a' = a1 + ... + aN}
state
  advices: Topic -&gt; set Text
  name: Topic lone -&gt; one Text
actions
  newTopic (name: Text, out t: Topic)
  addAdvice (t: Topic, advice: Text)
  getAdvice (t: Topic, out advices: set Text)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Side notes</strong>. This is a strange concept because it has so little behavior but it seems to represent a very significant part of the tutor, and would likely have its own code. I’ve included an action <em>getAdvice</em> to help reify the operational principle even though the state is visible and observer actions aren’t generally needed (but I think I should rethink this for OP-relevant state observations). At first, I incorporated advice into a concept that managed exercise/part structure, but then when I realized that that concept needed to incorporate the student behavior, it became too complex and I decided this was a better concept to factor out than a student behavior concept. Could this concept be made more similar to one that already exists, such as a Q&amp;A concept of the sort you might use to model StackOverflow etc? In the AI tutor setting, the advice will be given to the chatbot, not the student, but this should be irrelevant in the design of the concept.</p>
<p>The pedagogical content is organized as a collection of exercises with multiple parts; the parts are associated with competencies (which will be the topics for advice).</p>
<pre><code>concept Exercise [Competency]
purpose maintain and offer structured exercises
principle
  // admin creates exercise with parts
  // when student selects part, they get 
  // the relevant descriptions
  newExercise(te, e); newPart (e, tp, c, p);
   selectPart (e, p, t', c') {t' = te^tp, c' = c}
state
  parts: Exercise one -&gt; set Part
  competence: Part -&gt; one Competency
  description: Exercise + Part -&gt; one Text
actions
  newExercise (t: Text, out e: Exercise)
  newPart (e: Exercise, t: Text, c: Competency, out p: Part)
  selectPart (e: Exercise, p: Part, out t: Text, out c: Competency)
  // when student selects a part of an exercise,
  // they're given a description that combines
  // the description of the exercise with the 
  // description of the part (and the competency
  // they'll acquire)
</code></pre>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Both exercises and their parts have descriptions</li>
<li>Competency associated only with parts and not whole exercises. This will mean we can’t associate advice with exercises as a whole. Perhaps advice common to all parts is just included for those parts?</li>
<li>Parts are not shared between exercises</li>
<li>Considered including student behavior in this concept to make it richer but then decided it was more important to factor it out so that the student behavior concept could be lifted over students (that is, each student behavior being independent)</li>
</ul>
<p>Concept for student behavior:</p>
<pre><code>concept Drill
purpose govern student work blah...
principle
  // if you select a task and one of its subtasks
  // and then submit a solution, it's recorded
  // appropriately
  selectTask (t); selectSubTask (t, t'); 
  submit (s) {t' in t.subtasks and t.solution = s}
state
  subtasks: Task one -&gt; set Task
  solution: Task -&gt; lone Text
  current: lone Task
actions
  selectTask (t: Task)
  // set current to t
  selectSubTask (super, sub: Task)
  // set current to sub
  // ensure sub a subtask of super
  submit (t: Text)
  // current.solution := t
</code></pre>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Decided to make this cursor-based; not sure this is a good idea, but seems useful to have this state somewhere in the app.</li>
<li>OP is not very satisfying but at least suggests how concept is used.</li>
