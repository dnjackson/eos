It’s a dangerous criterion for comparison between products, because more complicated purposes often demand more complicated solutions. Photoshop cannot be as simple as Instagram (although perhaps it can be simpler than it is). Minimalist: Some writers advocate minimalism as a universal requirement of good design. It’s an attractive and compelling claim, but it seems to me a preference that is cultural and personal rather than universal.
